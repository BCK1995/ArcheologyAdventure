# ArcheologyAdventure

This is my program submission for the major project assignment in CMIS202 taught by Francis Seidel.

This is a simple 2 dimensional game with retro pixel graphics. I plan to impliment a number of things
in the future to (attempt to) make it into a bit of an open world rpg with lore and mythology. As of
12/09/22 v0.5 it is only a map in which the player character can walk around. It does have save/load
capabilities and there is also an npc and limited interraction with him. No options have been implimented
in the pause menu yet either.

The controls are the standard "WASD" for movement, "E" for action/interraction, and "Esc" to pause.
The pause menu controls are "W" and "S" for moving the selector up and down, "E" to enter a selection,
and "Esc" to open/close the pause screen.
